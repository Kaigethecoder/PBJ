# PBJ
The PBJ Shop is a simple application that welcomes the user to the shop, asks them how many are eating and prints out the amount of ingredients/packages needed.
App assumes each person will eat one sandwich consisting of 2 slices of bread, two tablespoons of peanut butter and four teaspoons of jelly.
1 loaf of bread = 28 slices, 1 jar of peanut butter = 32 tablespoons, 1 jar of jelly = 48 teaspoons.
